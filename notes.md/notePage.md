This is a useful link containing a bunch of syntax "https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax"

EXAMPLE STARTUP - "https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/tree/main" 

My server IP is http://98.80.67.144/ and I have allocated an elastic address, REMEMBER TO CANCEL AFTER THE TERM But the new permanent one is http://3.229.25.250/

Using the Amazon Route 53 service I was able to purchase and link the domain http://lorecore.click and link it to the IP address, so now searching that opens my website.
