# Elevator Pitch
Collaborative storytelling is the core of all Table Top Role Playing Games, but the biggest burden in that often falls to the Game Master. As Game Master, it is your responsibility to hold all the world-building, history,and environment knowledge in your head and be ready to spit it out to the players at any moment. One can always write it all down and hand it to the players, but then they'd have access to elements of the story or history that maybe they shouldn't. With the Lore Core, the Game Master and players alike can have access to all the information they need about the realm and only what they need. The Game Master controls which bit of information can be accessed by each player specifically, or locate certain information to different fantasy races or origins. Now the Dwarf Barbarian can reference relevant history of the Mountian Kingdom they are traveling through, as the Elvish Cleric refreshes his knowlegde of the local dieates without having to slow the game as the Game Master frantically searches through his notes.
